        There comes a time in the course of human history when beings of sound mind, body, and spirit must put forth immutable laws whereby indibsputable ownership is established. This fundamental and foundational element of society shall forever and always be established under the mantle dibs.
        <br /><br />
        We, the first Congress of Dibs, hereby establish the laws of dibs which all civilized people are obligated to abide and follow under excruciating penalty which can include, but is not limited to, exile, dismemberment, mean-name calling, and execution until dead.

If the deceased did not leave a legally binding will prior to his or her passing, all previous claims of dibs are considered expired as of the date and time of the previous dibs owner’s death and the item/collection is considered to be “undibsed” until dibs is claimed by a subsequent party.

              In the event that a claim of dibs is disputed, the challenger must be able to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the claim is invalid or make seek an impartial mediator who will also be approved by the challenged party. This mediator may pass judgement on whether or not the challenge is valid. If, at any point, the mediator determines they are at an impasse and cannot determine the truth of the matter, both parties must give up all claims of dibs on the dibsputed item/collection permanently. Said item/collection then is subject to the rules of the undibsed. See above articles.

This nominee must then be ratified by a two-thirds majority of the Congress of Dibs. A party cannot in any way call dibs on a seat in the Congress of Dibs. This is punishable by being driven over by a zamboni with a Congress appointed driver/executioner at a rink of the Congress’ choosing.
