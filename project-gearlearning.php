                        I developed the Gear Learning brand from top to bottom. I developed logos, documentation, business cards, document templates, styleguides, signage, brand assets, swag and merchandise, social media assets, convention booth banners/stands, and much more.

                        To say that I'm lucky to have worked with the people I've worked with over the years is an understatement. Truly some of the best, hardest working, talented, honest, loyal people I've ever met have worked along side me as we worked on building games to help make an impact in how people learn. The projects are really special to me and the people I worked with are family. I am blessed to have them in my life.
