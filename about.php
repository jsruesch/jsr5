                        I'm Jake. I feel there are few things that work as an outlet for creative expression as well as art. Over the I've developed a deep love for a wide variety of visual designs and mediums. I could be directing a team of artists to execute artistic vision, grabbing a set of images and turning them into a cohesive, dynamic composition, creating a responsive, user-friendly, intuitive website or creating high-detail vector art. You name it; I’m into it. In the world of art and design, there is so much to explore it’s a waste not to try out different styles and mediums.
